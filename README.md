Opinions on Switching Seats to Sit with Family, data from FiveThirtyEight

## Why I Chose This Question

While browsing a dataset on flying etiquette, this particular question — *“Is it rude to ask someone to switch seats with you in order to be closer to family?”* — stood out to me.

I was recently on a Southwest flight (where currently there are no assigned seats), and someone asked me to switch seats so they could sit with a family member. I immediately said yes, but this made me wonder: do most people consider that kind of request rude?

Analyzing the responses helped me explore how people view personal space and social obligations when flying.
